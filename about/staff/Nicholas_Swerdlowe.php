Born in New York and raised in Fairfield County Connecticut, from an early age he has traveled extensive and frequently visits Scandinavia. He is a bicultural and bilingual dual citizen of both the United States and the Kingdom of Norway. "When a member of the Senior Staff told me about Foster Skills, I became enamoured with his enthusiasum and dedication in making a difference within the community. The Foster Skills staff has a passion which is contagious, and a drive that will help the community indefinitely. So, I too wanted to help make a difference in the lives of children." 
<br><br>Nicholas will be responsible for generating foreign interest and awareness of Foster Skills' goals. He will also work on special communications projects, such as an upcoming series of videos.
<br><br>Since the fall of 2007, Nicholas has attended the Savannah College of Art and Design where he is pursuing a double major in Graphic and Industrial Design and is currently a Dean's List Student.
