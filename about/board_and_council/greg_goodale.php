Dr. Greg Goodale is a graduate of George Mason University (BA and MA), the University of Virginia School of Law (JD), and the University of Illinois (PhD) where he performed research in Rhetoric and American History. A former lawyer, lobbyist, and congressional aide, Dr. Goodale continues his interest in democracy and in particular how American citizenship intersects with race, gender, species and disability. As a public advocate (mostly for people with disabilities), Greg brings his Washington, DC experience into the classroom and into his scholarship. That experience is now used to lead classes that advocate on behalf of foster children (Advocacy Workshop) and that write speeches and advocacy materials for non-profit organizations in the Boston area (Advocacy Writing).

Dr. Goodale's research lies at the intersection of three key themes in an emerging philosophy called Post-Humanism. This intersection undermines the dominance of vision as a way of organizing the world into categories and classes in favor of rethinking concepts like sex, race, species and citizenship. Greg's books, Arguments About Animal Ethics and Sonic Persuasion: Reading Sound in the Recorded Age, and his journal articles like "Black and White: Vestiges of Biracialism in American Discourse" and "The Presidential Sound" are examples of Post-Humanist scholarship. Dr. Goodale has completed his next monograph, The Invention of "Man," and has begun to work on a new book project titled "Against Truth." His scholarship on sound, in particular, has been quoted in political magazines like The New Republic and Les Influences Politiques Medias Culture.
