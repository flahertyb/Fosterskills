<strong style="font-weight:bold">Why Foster Skills?</b></strong>
<br>
Foster Skills provides me with a unique opportunity to give back to those in need in my community. I am an extremely motivated individual, but I haven't always been. Through Foster Skills I will have the chance to help someone avoid making some of the same mistakes I made during high school.
