<b><strong style="font-weight:bold; font-size:medium; line-height:18px">Bartholomew Flaherty</b></strong><br><strong style="font-size:medium; line-height:18px">Vice President of Technology</strong>
<br><br><br><br><br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Why Foster Skills?</b></strong> <br>Bart has always had an affinity for helping, teaching, and understanding.
<br><br>In high school, he worked as a tutor at T.E.A.M., a summer program in Hartford that teaches math and promotes diversity.  This past year, Bart did advocacy work in the Massachusetts legislature for bills that would improve educational stability and sibling visitation rights for foster children (S.37 and H.451).
<br><br>Bart met Marquis at the Boston Dialectical Society, a debate group at Northeastern, in early 2011.  They began discussing the concept of a web portal of contacts and resources designed for foster children, inspired by the work of students in Greg Goodale's advocacy workshop class.
<br><br>Since then, Marquis brought Bart onto the senior leadership team to develop the Foster Skills website.  His role is to manage the organization's web presence, and to lend his writing and advocacy skills when needed.
<br><br>In the past, Bart has been employed to do policy research, technical writing, and internet marketing.  Currently, he works at State Street Global Advisors in IT Business Management.  In his free time, he enjoys cooking, running, jazz, debate, and non-fiction.</p>
