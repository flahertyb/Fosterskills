<h2 class="main-text">Former foster youth are doing amazing things.</h2>
<p class="main-text">Meet Sixto Cancel, who at a very young age decided not to be another statistic. Through self-motivated hard work and careful saving, Sixto is now attending Virginia Commonwealth University, and sitting on conference panels at Harvard Law School.<br>
<br>
Meet Kellyse Hood, who channeled the frustrations and difficulties of an unstable childhood into school, and graduated valedictorian with a full scholarship to Northeastern University.<br>
<br>
And meet Kimberly Snodgrass, whose dedication to public policy led her to study at Princeton and Harvard. She's written two books and started her own nonprofit, REACH.

These practical, successful adults who have turned their struggles
against adversity into unstoppable forward momentum. We are honored to
tell their stories.</p></div> <!-- END RIGHT MAIN --></div> <!-- END -->
