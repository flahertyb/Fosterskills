<br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Why Foster Skills?</b></strong> <br>Chris has always had a passion for social justice. By way his work through the Long Island Food Bank and the Roxbury YMCA, Chris developed an interest in adoption law. Specifically, he has been researching the Adoption and Safe Families Act(1997) in trying to facilitate better communication between federal and state adoption agencies in order to ensure that the mental and physical security of adopted children is protected. Chris signed on to Foster Skills intending to make a real difference in the lives of children.
