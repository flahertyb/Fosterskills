<p class="main-text">Every day, our staff wakes up believing that all foster youth deserve opportunities to achieve success. Our backgrounds are diverse - from politics to finance, from education to design - but we are all here for the same reason.</p>
<p class="main-text">We know foster youth have immense potential to achieve, and it is our goal to unlock it. We believe in education and the value of  practical life skills, and we intend to keep our expectations high. We know that the smallest effort can have the greatest impact, and we are willing to put in that effort.</p>
<p class="main-text">We believe in change. We believe in achievement. We believe in perseverance, support, and high expectations. We have the opportunity to shape lives, to build futures, to produce valuable, capable, productive citizens. </p>
