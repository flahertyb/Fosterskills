<h2 class="main-text">Every child deserves the chance to succeed. We are doing our part to make that happen.</h2>
<p class="main-text">Foster Skills addresses a simple fact: 
today's foster youth, through no fault of their own, are paying the price for either the shortcomings of individuals, or systemic inaction and imprudent action--and many times both. Developmentally unprepared and with few guaranteed supports, many foster youth will go on to present enormous challenges to their communities.<br><br>
<strong style="font-weight:bold;">Foster Skills aims to shape lives and build futures by helping foster youth beat odds and grow into productive citizens. </b></strong>
<br><br>Our Collaborative Efficacy Program provides youth in foster care the resources, support, and practical skill-building education that they need in order to succeed now and in the future. </p>
