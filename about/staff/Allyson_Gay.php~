<b><strong style="font-weight:bold; font-size:medium; line-height:18px">Allyson Gay</b></strong><br><strong style="font-size:medium; line-height:18px">Vice President of Community Initiatives</strong><br><br>
<br><br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Why Foster Skills?</b></strong> <br>Allyson has always had a passion for adoption law, being an adoptee herself. Allyson coached youth soccer while growing up and has always been involved in helping others. She was a volunteer youth mentor for Adoption and Foster Care (AFC) Mentoring. While at Northeastern, she has had two articles published, "The Law of Adoption: A Time for Change" as well as "Reforming the Insanity Defense: A Need for a Psychological Defect Plea". She has shown a profound interest in making a change in the laws of adoption and foster care. Through her experiences as an adoptee and as a mentor at AFC Mentoring, Allyson is hopeful that she can make a real difference in the lives of the children we encounter. 
<br><br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Outside of Foster Skills:</b></strong> <br>Allyson has worked for ProMutual Group, a medical malpractice liability insurance firm; Martin, Magnuson, McCarthy & Kenney, a medical malpractice defense law firm in Boston; and Melick, Porter & Shea a civil defense law firm in Boston.
<br><br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Fun fact:</b></strong> <br>Allyson is a sports guru.
<br><br><b><strong style="font-weight:bold">"Allyson is not only exceptionally intelligent, but also has a dedicated and tireless work ethic. Allyson's analytical and organizational skills are refined beyond her years."</b></strong><br> John F. Rooney III, Attorney and Member, Melick, Porter & Shea
