<b><strong style="font-weight:bold">Sixto Cancel entered foster care when he was 11 months old.</strong></b><br><br> After moving through several foster homes, Sixto began to worry about what was going to become of him. As he grew older, he realized the outcomes for young people his age in foster care weren't that great, and decided to take action so that he would not be another statistic. <br><br>He chaired his local child welfare Youth Leadership Board and enrolled as an Opportunity Passport participant where he saved and matched for multiple CD's, deposit for his apartment and a car, that provided him with opportunities for better employment, becoming more independent and furthering his education. <br><br>Now known by his friends as "Mr. Busybody", Sixto designed and ran a funded pilot program to prepare foster children for adulthood through post-secondary education called Stellar Works. Sixto has served as a Young Fellow for Jim Casey Youth Opportunity Initiatives, served four years as Connecticut State Treasurer for the NAACP Youth and College Division, and serves on the American Institutes for Research LGBTQQA Advisory Board. Sixto has been asked to speak on panels at the Center for Enterprise Development, Harvard University and Jim Casey Convening's.<br><br>Sixto is now living on his own as a freshman Virginia Commonwealth University.
